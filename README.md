### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I live by the line "infusing life into my code".
I am good at initiating conversations and I have affluent public speaking skills.
I am currently a Beta Microsoft Student Partner. I like to participate in hackathons, technical workshops and seminars, as well as organise them.
I like to learn new technologies. I recently learned to make a website using MERN stack. I also completed a data science professional certificate from IBM by coursera.
I am practicing competitive coding these days and focusing on data structure and algorithms.
I like to do Yoga, write poetries, and play guitar.
